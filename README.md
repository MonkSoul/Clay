# This Repo Description
This is an import from the Clay project's [CodePlex repository](http://clay.codeplex.com) as it was on 2016/07/15.

The purpose of this repo is to have a version that builds with modern dependencies and perhaps to make (what I consider) improvements.  I did this because I've always admired Clay for a) it's flexibility and b) it's mind-bending implementation.  :) 

The imported version is available as-is under the [canonical](https://github.com/jhorv/clay/tree/canonical) branch.

Submit pull requests at will, this code is too cool to leave unused, or at the very least, unstudied!

# License Notes
Please note that this code retains the license from the CodePlex project - the [Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MS-PL).

Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_source#Microsoft_Public_License_.28Ms-PL.29):

> This is the least restrictive of the Microsoft licenses and allows for distribution of compiled code for either commercial or non-commercial purposes under any license that complies with the Ms-PL. Redistribution of the source code itself is permitted only under the Ms-PL.

While I prefer the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), I expect the Ms-PL is permissive enough for most anyone.

If the original authors choose to re-license to something even more permissive, that change will be reflected here.
